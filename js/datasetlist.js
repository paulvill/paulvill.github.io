		"Time-lapse movie of Drosophila melanogaster embryonic development with stained nuclei in gray, showing a cross section taken at ~90 μm from the posterior pole of the embryo during gastrulation. The movie has been colored with the enzyme dpERK in red, two transcription factors, Twist in green and Dorsal in pink, and transcripts of two genes, ind in blue and rhomboid in yellow. These molecular components are elements of the gene regulatory network that patterns the Dorso-Ventral axis of the embryo.",
